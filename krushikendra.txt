In the above ER diagram, the entities are represented as rectangles, and the attributes are listed within them. The primary keys are underlined, and the relationships between entities are shown using lines and cardinality notation (1 for one and N for many).

Here's a summary of the relationships:

A Farmer can have multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
An Expert can have multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
An Article is associated with one Farmer or Expert (1 to 1 relationship).
A Crop can have multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
A Livestock can have multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
Weather information can be associated with multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
A Market can have multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
A Government Scheme can be associated with multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
A Training Resource can be associated with multiple Articles (1 to N relationship).
Note that this is a simplified representation, and in a real-world scenario, there could be additional entities and relationships depending on the specific requirements of the "Krushi Kendra" system.
